      <p><b>The sixteenth edition of Culture Night took place on Friday 17 September 2021.</b></p>
			
      <p>Culture Night is brought to you by the Arts Council; it is a national moment, celebrating all that makes up the richness and diversity of culture in Ireland today, connecting people to cultural activities locally and nationally and aims to open up pathways to ongoing engagement.</p>
      
      <p>Doors are opened late and special and unique events are specifically programmed at participating locations and, thanks to the continued support of the Arts Council and Local Authorities across the island of Ireland, all activities are made available to the public free of charge.</p>
      
	    <p>&#9825; It showcases the very best in Irish culture. &#9825;</p>
